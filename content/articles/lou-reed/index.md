  <h3 class="article-subtitle">Favorite Quotes from the Film</h3>

  <p><span class="intro">LOU REED</span>: <em>I was interested in subject matter that hadn't been covered in pop and rock. I had dreams of writing certain kinds of things. I was influenced by Burroughs and Ginsberg. Raymond Chandler and Hubert Selby, I thought. that's what I want to do except with a drum and guitar.</em></p>

  <p><span class="intro">DAVID BOWIE</span>: <em>Lou Reed brought rock and roll into the avant-garde.</em></p> 
    
  <p><span class="intro">JOHN CALE</span>: <em>Lou was lyrically really incredible in a different sort of way. I think Lou created mythology on the street.</em></p>
  
  <p><span class="intro">LOU REED</span>: <em>I think of New York as being something almost like my DNA. you know, I have my parents and then there's New York.</em></p>

  <p><span class="intro">RONNIE CUTRONE</span>: <em>The 60's have a reputation of being, you know, totally cool; and the fact was there was 35 cool people in New York at the time, tops.</em></p>

  <p><span class="intro">JIM CARROLL</span>: <em>The Velvet Underground was like the band but, as Lou once said, everyone thinks we're great but we don't have a pot to piss in.</em></p>

  <p><span class="intro">DAVID BYRNE</span>: <em> l love the song "Walk On The Wild Side"...but I'd hear it on the radio all the time and you'd hear it in restau­rants and bars and bus stations, whatever. And I'd wonder — do any of these people have any idea of what's being talked about, who is being talked about, and what's going on?</em></p>

  <p><span class="intro">HOLLY WOODLAWN</span>: <em>I plucked my eyebrows, I shaved, I... you know, from one end of the country to the other...</em></p>

  <p><span class="intro">JOE DALLESANRO</span>: <em>And you are still a very beautiful girl. Very beautiful girl.</em></p>

  <p><span class="intro">THURSTON MOORE</span>: <em>To sing so explicitly about heroin, should be considered one of the most groundbreaking things in Rock and Roll. And it definitely was. I think lyric writing for a lot of people after that was never the same.</em></p>

  <p><span class="intro">CHARLIE ROSE</span>: <em>How bad was it [drug use] at the worst?</em></p>
  <p><Lead>LOU REED</Lead>: <em>As bad as it gets.</em></p>

  <p><span class="intro">LOU REED</span>: <em>Glam rock, androgyny, polymorphic sex. I was right in the middle of it. Some say I could have been at the head of the class.</em></p>

  <blockquote>I think real­ly with Lou, the poet in him won out.</blockquote>

  <p><span class="intro">DAVID FRICKE</span>: <em>One thing I remember from the liner notes about that record [Metal Machine Music] — it was something like "my week beats your year" and I thought man, that is the shit, he's saying if you don't like it, I don't care.</em></p>

  <p><span class="intro">VACLAV HAVEL</span>: <em>I know Lou Reed a long time as a musician and also personally and I like him very much. He and his Velvet Underground influenced very much the rock music in our country, which played in former time the special social role.</em></p>

  <p><span class="intro">PATTI SMITH</span>: <em>One wants to communicate with the people... one wants to mind-meld with the people... but one must do their work and be the guardian of their work and I think real­ly with Lou, the poet in him won out.</em></p>

  <p><span class="intro">PHILLIP GLASS</span>: <em>It is not music that is made as a reaction to a particular market place. It really comes from the inside and by that I mean that it comes from Lou's own consciousness. </em></p>
